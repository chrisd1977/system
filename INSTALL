Installation instructions

There is a configure script in this directory that is used to specify
the installation prefixes. This needs to be run before make commands
can be issued.  The following make targets are of relevance to the
user.

make
    Make without target compiles the system executable.

make check
    Run the unit tests.

make install
    Install the system executable and the standard library.

make uninstall
    Undoes the 'make install' command.

make clean
    Delete all compiled files.

make distclean
    In addition to what 'make clean' does also undo the actions of
    the configure script.
